      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I am an American scholar currently working on the support staff for the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (<a href="http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/home/" target="_blank">ALMA</a>) project at the North American ALMA Science Center (<a href="https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma/intro-naasc" target="_blank">NAASC</a>) headquarters on the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. For my work homepage, go <a href="http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~amcnicho/">here</a>.</p>
      <p>For the last half decade I have been helping international collaborations solve complex problems in computing and astrophysics. Some of my particular professional pursuits include data collection and representation, the development and operation of advanced technology, and technical research investigations that expand the limits of human understanding. I matriculated from the <a href="http://www.astro.uhh.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank">University of Hawai'i - Hilo</a> in 2014 after three years' practical and theoretical study in the natural sciences.</p>
      <p>My primary long-term goal is to engage in and facilitate exploration that advances collective knowledge of the most awesome frontiers and eventually ensures permanent human presence in free space. In the meantime I have staken a claim to the title of "Most <em>Interested</em> Man on the World." I like to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/shen/planyourvisit/hiking-opportunities.htm">roam forests</a>, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram">solve puzzles</a>, and test my limits. My favorite autonymous anagram is "Rancid Clown Mesh" and I have never lost an eating contest.</p>
      <!--<p>On self-reported psychometric evaluations of "big five" model personality trait aspects (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.513.2517&rep=rep1&type=pdf">DeYoung CG, Quilty LC, Peterson JB. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 2007;93:880-896</a>), I score about average in compassion, very low in politeness (low agreeableness in general); very low in industriousness, high in orderliness (moderately low conscientiousness in general); low in enthusiasm, moderately high in assertiveness (moderately low extraversion in general); high withdrawal, moderately high volatility (moderately high neuroticism in general); average intellect, and high openness (moderately high openness to experience in general). Through no fault of my own, I am relatively more intelligent than average (see <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2014105">Plomin, R.; Deary, I.J. Genetics and intelligence differences: five special findings. Molecular Psychiatry volume 20, pages 98â€“108 (2015) doi:10.1038/mp.2014.105</a></li>)</p>-->
